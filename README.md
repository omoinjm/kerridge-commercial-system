## Assignment

**Problem Statement: Sales Taxes**

Basic tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food, and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional tax applicable on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exceptions.

When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of items, and the total amount of tax paid.

The rounding rules for tax are:
For a tax rate of n%, a shelf price of p contains (np / 100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of tax.

Write an application that prints out the receipt details for these shopping baskets:
